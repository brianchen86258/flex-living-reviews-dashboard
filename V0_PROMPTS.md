## Integration Tips

After generating components with v0.dev:

1. **Copy the component code** from v0.dev

   ```
   I have a component from v0.dev for the reviews table.
   Please:
   - Save it to frontend/components/ReviewsTable.tsx
   - Connect it to our API at /api/reviews
   - Use React Query for data fetching
   - Add proper TypeScript types from lib/types.ts
   - Handle loading and error states
   - Add the route in app/dashboard/page.tsx
   ```

3. **Test the integration**:
   - Start both servers
   - Navigate to the page
   - Verify API calls in Network tab
   - Test all interactions

4. **Iterate**:
   - Ask Claude Code to fix any issues
   - Adjust styling or behavior
   - Add additional features

- Warning: Yellow (bg-yellow-500)
- Danger: Red (bg-red-500)
- Neutral: Gray (bg-gray-100, text-gray-600)

**Effects:**
