## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start the Backend

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # Already created during setup
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
Database initialized
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Step 2: Sync Reviews to Database

Open http://localhost:8000/docs

1. Find **POST /api/reviews/sync**
2. Click "Try it out"
3. Click "Execute"
4. You should see: "Synced 7 new reviews from Hostaway"

This populates the database with mock review data.

### Step 3: Start the Frontend

```bash
# Terminal 2
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.x
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 4: Open the Dashboard

Visit: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

You should see:
- **Stats cards** showing total reviews, average rating, properties, pending approvals
- **Filter controls** for searching and filtering reviews
- **Reviews table** with all reviews, sortable columns, pagination
- **Approval toggles** to approve/disapprove reviews
- **Featured stars** to mark reviews as featured
- **Sync button** in the header to sync more reviews

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### Test 1: View Reviews
1. Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. You should see 7 reviews in the table
3. Check that all data displays correctly:
   - Property names
   - Guest names
   - Ratings (stars + numbers)
   - Dates
   - Channel badges (Airbnb/Booking.com)

### Test 2: Approve a Review
1. Find any review where "Approved" toggle is OFF
2. Click the toggle to turn it ON
3. You should see a green toast: "Review approved!"
4. The toggle should stay ON

### Test 3: Feature a Review
1. Click the star icon next to any review
2. Star should turn yellow (featured)
3. You should see a toast: "Review featured!"
4. Click again to unfeature

### Test 4: Filter Reviews
1. Use the search box to search for a guest name (e.g., "Sarah")
2. Reviews should filter instantly
3. Try the property dropdown
4. Try the channel dropdown
5. Click "Reset Filters" to clear all

### Test 5: Sort Reviews
1. Click "Property" column header
2. Reviews should sort alphabetically
3. Click again to reverse order
4. Try sorting by Rating, Date, etc.

### Test 6: Sync More Reviews
1. Click "Sync Reviews" button in header
2. Button should show "Syncing..." with spinner
3. Toast should show "Reviews synced successfully!"
4. (Since mock data is same, you'll see "0 new reviews")

### Test 7: Check API Responses
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
4. Toggle approval on a review

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Frontend won't start
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend errors
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### CORS errors
- Make sure backend is running on port 8000
- Check `frontend/.env.local` has: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- Check `backend/.env` has: `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000`

### No reviews showing
- Make sure you ran POST `/api/reviews/sync` first
- Check backend terminal for errors
- Check Network tab in browser DevTools

### TypeScript errors
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
Fix any type errors that appear.
